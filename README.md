# react-redux-for-dummies
An incremental step by step practical method to understand and get familiar with the basics of React and Redux. The tasks are divided into days assuming you spend just 1 or 2 hours per day on this task. You are welcome to finish the tasks at your own speed.

## Pre requisites

I used this method to onboard myself with React and Redux and found it effective.
I would be glad to receive comments and feedback or ways to improve this method.
